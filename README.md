# The Great Retention

MNC Company HR Data


## Project Proposal

Our project is to predict job retention based on: 
satisfaction level, 
results of the last evaluation,
number of project completed, 
average montly hours, 
number of years with the company, 
the occurrence of work accidents, 
whether the employee recieved a promotion in the last five years, 
department, 
and salary.

We will create a predictive model using __________ ...

* The kind of data you'd like to work with and the field you're interested in (e.g., trading, quantitative analysis).

* Possible source for such data.

* Candidate machine learning or statistical models that you may want to explore.

This constitutes your Project Proposal and Outline, and it should look something like this:

> Our project is to predict credit card fraud. We'll fit a random forest algorithm to lending club data to create a predictive model. We will also fit a deep neural network model to the data and compare the performance of both models to determine which has sufficient predictive power.

## Finding Data

We decided to use MNC company HR data from Kaggle.

## Data Preparation & Model Training

1. Change the percentage data to decimal format
2. Dropped the emp ID column

Used Jupyter lab and AWS SageMaker to prepare a training and testing dataset and to train the machine-learning models.


## Model Evaluation

Use the testing data to evaluate the model (X amount of models) to see which model would be the best model to use for our data. 

We used the following models:
* Logistic Regression Model
* Decision Tree Model
* Gradient Boosted Tree Model
* Random Forest Model
* Gaussian Naive Bayes Model
* Support Vector Machines

## Predictions and Conclusions

Summarize your conclusions and predictions. This should include a numerical summary (what data your model yielded), as well as visualizations of that summary (plots of the final model evaluation and predictions).
