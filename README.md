# The Great Retention

MNC Company HR Data


## Project Proposal


Write this as a brief summary of your interests and intent, including:

* The kind of data you'd like to work with and the field you're interested in (e.g., trading, quantitative analysis).

* Possible source for such data.

* Candidate machine learning or statistical models that you may want to explore.

This constitutes your Project Proposal and Outline, and it should look something like this:

> Our project is to predict credit card fraud. We'll fit a random forest algorithm to lending club data to create a predictive model. We will also fit a deep neural network model to the data and compare the performance of both models to determine which has sufficient predictive power.

## Finding Data

The we decided to use MNC company HR data from Kaggle.

## Data Preparation & Model Training

1. Change the data from xlsx format to csv format.
2. Change the percentage data to decimal format
3. Removed the emp ID
Machine learning typically requires extensive data preparation before the model can be trained. Use Jupyter, Google Colab, or AWS SageMaker to prepare a training and testing dataset and to train the machine-learning model.

Use the training data to fit the model.

## Model Evaluation

Use the testing data to evaluate the model. Create any necessary tables, charts, plots, or statistical analysis to report the model performance.

## Predictions and Conclusions

Summarize your conclusions and predictions. This should include a numerical summary (what data your model yielded), as well as visualizations of that summary (plots of the final model evaluation and predictions).
